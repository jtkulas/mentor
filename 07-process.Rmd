![](images\manage.jpg)

This page primarily serves as a procedural overview, so future Eagle I.O cohorts can implement and manage the Mentorship program.

Procedurally, Eagle I.O members:

1) Guage interest and availability via administering a  [survey](https://survey.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1TFZ0AIYBpsyh6Z) sent by the program director in July
    +  Several follow-up attempts are made during the summer 
    + Template documents:^[Note these documents are only available to individuals who have an e-mail address with the "montclair.edu" domain]  
        * [To Mentors](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oDPE6IKPpk-vFezMzAU6uGP9HiTDfH4DSmJT1TQdXYU)  
        * [To First Year Mentees](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BWLyBbBIcMEBeRxTNhBaLzbWkEPXThcO44qSh4HwTpw)  
        * [First Two Events](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_W0KReXqGGoR6jn1zabX6syhJ2sNjMZH8RPBwtfbnI/edit?usp=sharing)

2) Eagle I.O consultants match interested mentors and mentees
    + This is done prior to orientation
3) Matches are introduced before orientation by email and discuss future events (see Chapter \@ref(timeline)) 
4) The program is monitored periodically (see Chapter \@ref(Eagle) "Eagle I.O Responsibilities")
